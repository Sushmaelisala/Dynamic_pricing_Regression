# Dynamic_pricing_Regression:

ðŸ’° Dynamic Pricing Using Machine Learning:

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to implement dynamic pricing based on various factors affecting price trends. Multiple regression algorithms are applied and evaluated for accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

Dynamic pricing refers to the strategy of adjusting prices in real-time or based on historical data trends to maximize revenue, efficiency, or competitiveness. In this project, we use different regression techniques to predict optimal pricing.

ðŸ“Š Models Implemented:

The notebook includes training and evaluation of the following models:

- Linear Regression

- Polynomial Regression

- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

- Random Forest Regression

- XGBoost Regression

- Each model is evaluated using:

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

- MSE (Mean Squared Error)

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

- RÂ² Score

Bar plots are created to compare the errors across models.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:

- Python

- Scikit-learn

- XGBoost

- Matplotlib

- NumPy

- Pandas

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
For each model, the following metrics are calculated:

- MAE: Measures average magnitude of error.

- MSE: Penalizes larger errors.

- RMSE: Interpretable error in original units.

- RÂ²: Indicates goodness of fit.

ðŸ”š Conclusion:

- The machine learning approach to dynamic pricing shows promising results.

- With fine-tuning and additional data, this model can be applied in real-time pricing engines.
